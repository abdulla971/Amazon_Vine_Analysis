# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
ETL and Sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews with AWS, PySpark, postgresql, NLP.

## Analysis Overview
In this project an analysis is performed on Amaozon Vine program to check if there exist a bias toward favorable reviews from Vine memebers. In order to complete the analysis PySpark is used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, load the transformed data into pgAdmin and calculate different metrics. It is noted that we focused on the US reviews for video games.
